    "# Q1. What is the Probability Density Function (PDF)?\n",
    "The Probability Density Function (PDF) is a function that describes the likelihood of a random variable taking on a specific value. For continuous random variables, the PDF gives the relative likelihood of the variable taking values within a certain range. The total area under the curve of a PDF is equal to 1, representing the total probability of all possible outcomes.\n",

    "# Q2. What are the types of Probability Distribution?\n",
    "Probability distributions are categorized based on the type of data (discrete or continuous) and the form of the distribution. The common types include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete Probability Distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Binomial Distribution: Models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, each with the same probability of success.\n",
    "Poisson Distribution: Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space when events happen independently at a constant rate.\n",
    "Geometric Distribution: Models the number of trials until the first success in a series of independent Bernoulli trials.\n",
    "Negative Binomial Distribution: Models the number of trials until a specified number of successes.\n",
    "Continuous Probability Distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal Distribution: Describes data that tends to cluster around a mean. It's bell-shaped and symmetric.\n",
    "Exponential Distribution: Models the time between events in a Poisson process.\n",
    "Uniform Distribution: All outcomes are equally likely within a given range.\n",
    "Gamma Distribution: A two-parameter family of continuous probability distributions often used to model waiting times."
